My Totally Non-Linear Timeline
learningTimeline:
- I started my journey with AI while working at JOL Energy. We had automated valves and needed to predict sensor values (like pH) to know when to open or close them without human monitoring. That’s when I stumbled into ML — and honestly, it started out of necessity, not curiosity.
- Learned ML basics, fiddled with models and functions, and then got obsessed with how cool it was. So I moved into Deep Learning — started with ANNs, and from there just kept going with the flow until I reached GenAI land 🧠✨.
- Web dev started because… I got jealous. I saw some really slick websites and went “okay that’s too good — I want to build that.” Also had to supervise devs at JOL who were building our site, and I didn’t want to be the clueless manager.
- Started with HTML/CSS + a sprinkle of JS → MERN stack → FastAPI → and now I just build whatever I feel like, usually based on some weird idea I had at 1am.
- It’s not a perfect timeline, but it’s mine. Learned everything the hard way (aka with Google, Stack Overflow, and emotional damage 😅).
Look — I won’t claim this was the “ideal” skill-learning timeline. It wasn’t a course syllabus. But it’s mine, it’s real, and honestly, I kinda love it. 


😊Projects:
1. Gesture Recognition Hand Cricket Game
This project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect hand gestures via a webcam in real-time. The game mimics traditional hand cricket, where player and computer gestures are compared to determine runs or outs. OpenCV and a trained ML model are used for gesture classification. The system maintains a score and updates it based on the game's rules. It offers an interactive, touchless gaming experience ideal for casual play.

2. Inventory Simulation
This system simulates inventory tracking, focusing on expiry dates and optimal container placement. MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage. Prisma ORM helps interact with the database in a type-safe, efficient way. The simulation allows adding, updating, and querying items with metadata like shelf life and storage zones. It helps visualize and test inventory logistics digitally before real-world deployment.

3. PDF Summarizer
The project provides a web-based interface for users to upload PDF documents. Once uploaded, the backend processes the file and extracts text using parsing libraries. It then uses an LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) to summarize the content intelligently. The summary is returned to the frontend, giving users a concise version of the PDF. It's useful for quickly understanding large documents like research papers or reports.

4. OAuth Login System
This is a secure authentication system built using OAuth2 and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Users can log in using third-party providers like Google or GitHub, reducing the need for separate passwords. OAuth2 handles secure token-based access delegation, while JWT ensures session integrity and user verification. The backend validates tokens, stores user sessions, and restricts access to protected routes. This setup is robust, modern, and commonly used in production web applications.

Learning Journey:
My journey began with a deep dive into Arduino and Embedded C, where I honed foundational skills in hardware-software integration. Through the Arduino platform, I learned to program microcontrollers using C/C++, gaining hands-on experience with GPIO, serial communication, and various sensor interfacing. Projects like blinking LEDs, building temperature monitoring systems, and controlling motors helped me solidify your understanding of how embedded systems interact with the physical world. This phase laid a solid foundation in embedded systems, sparking curiosity for more complex applications and a seamless transition into the world of software development.
