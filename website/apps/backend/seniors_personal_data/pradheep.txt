3. LEARNING TIMELINE
--------------------
- First year: Participated in a hackathon to build an emotional pet. Lacked experience but sparked curiosity.
- First year break: Learned HTML, CSS, JS → Moved into MERN stack. No LLMs or AI assistants — debugged everything manually. Spent 8 months learning advanced tooling like Turborepo, Docker, and CI/CD.
- Second year: Interned at eBramha Techworks. Wanted to revisit emotional pet idea but was new to ML.
- ML journey began *non-traditionally* — started with the paper “Attention is All You Need”. Googled terms, read 40+ papers. Built a multi-modal emotion recognition system using audio, text, and face.
- Third year: Joined Team Vyadh. Worked with ROS2, Intel RealSense D455, GPS, and sensors. Developed core controller of the autonomous stack. Handled 3D point cloud processing (PCL in C++) and visual object detection (OpenCV, YOLOv11). IRC 2025: Ranked 13th globally.
- Parallel: Built FrugalSOT — a smart LLM system with prompt complexity detection and model switching logic using Ollama. Added a low-pass filter at 2 AM for dynamic thresholds. Patent is being filed.
- Later: Built PHYDRA for ISRO ISS Hackathon — 3D bin-packing, ACO/Dijkstra pathfinding in C++, FastAPI backend. Lost due to Prisma env misconfig by judges — debugged with Docker/K8s.
- IRC 2025 prep: Stack crashed at 1 AM before final demo. Debugged entire night. Unique issue found during demo.
- Internship at Titan: Built AlphaDjango generator and multilingual SQL voice agent.  
- Now: Building HyperKuvid Labs — a rebel student-led community focused on breaking tutorial hell.

10. APART FROM DEV LIFE
------------------------
- I love watching and playing football — big fan of the sport.
- Also follow cricket and tennis regularly.
- Enjoy thoughtful and technical content from creators like Niklas Christl, Harkirat Singh, Tharun Speaks, and 3blue1Brown.
- Anime is my comfort zone — from philosophical classics to high-octane shonen, I watch it all.
- PC gaming is my go-to break when life gets too noisy — from story-driven games to strategy, I play what keeps me thinking.
- Sleep schedule: Dead. But always working on some 2 AM idea that probably breaks production 😅
- Not big on social media — prefer reflection over broadcasting.
- Love debugging not just code, but people too — genuinely enjoy mentoring and building real communities.
- Strong believer in learning by doing. Chaos over courses. Experience over exams.
- Once got roasted by a bug that cost a hackathon. Still smiling.
